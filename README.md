Random data generated by Geiger counter and by Intel RDSEED

The geiger.* files contain random Geiger counter data captured from a GMC 300+ Geiger counter. Each number inside the files (0,1,2,3, etc.) is the number of random radioactive particles detected since the meter's last check. Radiactive particle arrivals are unpredictable, making them truly random (at least as far as Science knows currently). 5 rounds of captures were conducted, each into a separate text file.  The 5 files were also XOR'd together (geiger_xor) and converted to binary to overwrite any long-running radiation events that might've generated predictable number runs.

The rdseed file contains random binary data from circuitry thermal noise captured from Assembly Language calls to the RDSEED function in an Intel i7-10510U CPU.

NIST and Dieharder randomness test outputs are included.
